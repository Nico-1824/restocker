Welcome to RestockerAI!

The goal of this AI is to identify pantry items from a picture and be able to keep count 
of them for you. It is made with PyTorch and running with a couple of convolution layers to 
extract features from the training dataset. It then sends a flattened outout of parameters 
through a linear layer to classify the item in the picture.
